# **SuperTalker: Affordable Assistive Communication Device**

This project is an initiative by the **GEC Thrissur Ideator Student Team** to design a **low-cost assistive speech device** for the **National Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (NIPMER)**. Inspired by the existing SuperTalker FeatherTouch device, our aim is to create an affordable alternative that promotes communication for individuals with speech disabilities.

---

## **Project Overview**
The SuperTalker device provides a customizable interface for recording and playing back audio messages. It uses **capacitive touch switches** for user input, making it accessible for individuals with limited dexterity. Key features include:

- **Customizable message grids**: Supports multiple messages with symbol overlays for visual assistance.
- **Capacitive touch interface**: A modern, durable, and easy-to-use input method.
- **APR33A3 audio playback IC**: Enables high-quality, standalone audio storage and playback.
- **Durable and portable design**: Lightweight and robust, suitable for everyday use.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Low Cost**: Designed with affordability in mind to increase accessibility.
- **Customizable Messages**: Record and store personalized audio messages for various use cases.
- **FeatherTouch Input**: Capacitive touch sensors replace traditional buttons for enhanced usability.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple overlays and interfaces ensure ease of use for all age groups.

## **Technology Stack**
### **Hardware**
- APR33A3 audio IC
- Capacitive touch sensors (e.g., TTP223)
- Rechargeable Li-ion battery

### **Software**
- Firmware for interfacing touch inputs with message triggers

### **Enclosure**
- Custom 3D-printed case for durability and aesthetics

## **Why This Project Matters**
Communication is a basic human need, yet many assistive devices are prohibitively expensive. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing an affordable, high-quality alternative that empowers individuals with speech disabilities to express themselves effectively.
